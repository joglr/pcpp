# Assignments & Oral Feedback

## Assignment Submission

Assignments are submitted bi-weekly in groups of 2-3 people.
Please use the group selection activity in LearnIT to create/join a group.
If you have problems finding a group, please contact Philip at (`phif@itu.dk`).

Every two weeks you submit an assignment with solutions to the exercises carried out the previous two weeks.
**The deadline for submitting assignments is Mondays at 07:59** (before the lecture starts).
We will enable a link in LearnIT for submitting assignments.


### What to submit

Upload your solutions to a repository at ITU's GitHub instance (https://github.itu.dk/).
In the submission form in LearnIT, please write the link (`<url>`) to the repository containing the solution.
Please check that it is possible to fetch your solution with a command like `$ git clone <url>`.
That is, the repository should be set to *Public* (this allows anyone with access to github.itu.dk to clone the repository).
Please also write in your submission: your group name, and the full names and GitHub usernames of all the members of the group.

**All members of a group should make a submission via LearnIT**.
This is important because each member of the group must get an individual grade (approved/not approved).
Also, LearnIT submissions are used to check whether students have fulfilled the requirements for taking the exam.
It is important that all members of a group submit the link to the **same** repository `<url>`.

The GitHub repository you submit should only have files related to the submission and follow the structure shown here: ([Assignment1/](Assignment1/)).

```
├── Assignment1
│   ├── Exercise1
│   │   ├── /*Here goes a file for textual answers*/
│   │   └── week01exercises
│   │       └── /*Here goes your project (Gradle or Erlang)*/
│   └── Exercise2
│       ├── /*Here goes a file for textual answers*/
│       └── week02exercises
│           └── /*Here goes your project (Gradle or Erlang)*/
```

The file for textual answers should be either: a plain text (e.g., `.txt` or `.md`) file, or a `.pdf` file. We should be able view the file with a regular text editor or PDF viewer. If you would like to use Microsoft Word or the like, please export the file to `.pdf` and add it in the repository.

The code of your solution must be submitted as a Gradle project or Erlang project. We suggest you start with the Gradle project or Erlang project that we publish every week with each exercise set in the folder `code-exercises`.
 
The repository should only have one branch. You may not modify any files in the submitted repository after submission. 
If you want to continue working on the submitted files, make a new copy of all files that you need for other work after the submission, or fork the repository into a new one.

*The code of mandatory assignments must compile and run in order for the submission to be approved.*


## Oral Feedback
For oral feedback sessions, **please have the code and explanation in your submissions ready before the feedback session starts.**
Be ready to compile/execute your code and open it in an editor. 
We will ask you both to explain and run (some of) the code. 
All members of a group must contribute.
All members of the group must be able to answer questions about any parts of the solution.
All members must participate in the oral feedback sessions, recall that each of you will get an individual grade.

### Booking
Each group needs to join a 40 min slot for oral feedback with TAs or teachers.
Note that slots allow for 6 people, so more than one group can join a slot.
**You must book a 40 min slot using the Oral Feedback Scheduler activity in LearnIT ([scheduler](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/organizer/view.php?id=206699)).**
The slot you choose is recurrent: it will take place on weeks 37, 39, 43, 45, 47 and 49  on the selected day and time.
**All members of the group must individually sign up in the same slot.**
TAs and teachers will make available several 40 min slots from which you can choose.

Oral feedback sessions will take place in-person at ITU.
The TA or teacher responsible for your session will book a room at ITU to conduct the sessions.

If you cannot attend any of the available slots, please contact Eduardo (`edtr@itu.dk`).

### Preparation for oral feedback

For your oral feedback sessions, **you should have your assignment ready to show either on a projector or via screen sharing.**
It is recommended that you spend some time before the oral feedback session to refresh the work you did on the assignment.
During the session, the TAs or teachers will assess whether the assignment is approved.
We seek to discuss the assignments with you to 

- better assist you in uncovering misunderstandings in your solutions, and 
- train you in discussing course material.

Therefore, you are encouraged to talk about course material that you find difficult to understand.
